# Artificial-Neural-Network-Project2 
This is a course project for the Artificial Neural Network course at NTNU. In this project, I built a DCGAN model to generate anime images. Due to computational constraints, the quality of the results cannot be compared with that of the prevailing pre-trained models, such as the pix2pix model. However, it was still a great experience to learn how to build a GAN model from scratch.
